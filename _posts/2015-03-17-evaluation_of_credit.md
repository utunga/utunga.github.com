# Understanding the evaluation of credit within monetary systems

This was originally an essay for the [iFlas MOOC](http://iflas.blogspot.co.nz/2014/12/money-and-society-mooc.html) in response to the question - something like (but not exactly) "What as an aspect of currency that you felt was not analyzed enough in this course?"


An important area that I think was insufficiently analysed in these lessons is the role that <strong>Evaluation Of Creditworthiness</strong> (EOC) plays in money like systems. How and who carries out this evaluation are important questions to ask when understanding credit money systems.

<strong>EOC in Hawala and the early Rothschild bank</strong>

In describing the Rothschild banking network in Lesson 1, it was emphasized that the strong family ties meant there was a high level of 'trust' between the various branches of the bank. This is true. However it is not <em>trust</em> alone that allowed the Rothschilds to transfer money internationally. The great stores of wealth available at each bank were also crucial to establishing those lines of credit.
Similarly, in the description of Hawala on Wikipedia [1] it is said that Hawala relies on "the performance and honour" of individual money brokers. It is notably not enough for a member of this network to be judged honourable, they must also have the ability to 'perform'. 

This additional requirement illustrates the difference between trust and credit. That is, in the modern approach, creditworthiness is seen as requiring (a) a depth of trust and (b) a positive estimation of the other parties 'ability to produce' in future.

It is also interesting, that in this scenario the parties who decide to extend credit to each other are in fact the different branches of the bank (or the network). It is the establishment of a 'network of credit' between these individual nods that allows money (of a kind) to move around - without the need for expensive gold caravans - and to be settled up (or cancelled off) later. 

<strong>EOC in gold-backed paper bank money.</strong>

One perspective on early paper money, is to frame the question of whether, say, a barkeep is willing to exchange a pint of beer for a piece of paper as a question of evaluation of credit.

We might consider that the barkeep is, in fact, evaluating the creditworthiness of the piece of paper (Notably not the credit of the punter). We might ask if they (a) 'trust' that this piece of paper is genuine and (b) have confidence that the paper will be 'able to produce' gold at a later date. [2]
EOC in 'commodity' currencies such as gold, bitcoin or reserve bank fiat currencies

In the usual treatment, bitcoin and (actual) gold are described as 'trust free' in that, at no point, does anyone have to evaluate the creditworthiness of any other party. For this reason I will leave them largely out of this analysis other than to note, that of course, you must have a positive expectation of the market value for gold, bitcoin or tulips tomorrow, to be willing to accept such instruments in payment today. So an evaluation is also required, but it is of a different nature. The dynamics of this are outside of the scope of this paper, but of course these dynamics can *also* play a role when considering whether to accept a particular credit currency (thus credit currencies can get the ‘best of both worlds’ as it were).

<strong>EOC in the expansion of bank credit.</strong>

It is in the expansion of bank balance sheets where we really begin to see the importance of credit evaluation. 

The course leaned heavily on the idea that banks create money 'out of thin air' and I agree that it was necessary to work hard to dismiss the misleading idea that banks merely 'lend out depositors funds'. Furthermore the position is well justified – at least in the form that the Bank of England expressed it:
<cite>"… rather than banks receiving deposits when households save and then lending them out, bank lending creates deposits" [3].</cite> 

However, it can also be misleading if this is taken to mean that banks create money out of ‘nothing at all’. I wonder if, in a desire to provide a strong anti-thesis to the oft repeated [4] orthodoxy, the authors of this course may have overcompensated. 

Because, if we examine bank credit expansion from a more sober perspective it is easy to see that there is more happening here than merely an unfair legal charter that allows banks alone to create money ‘out of nothing’.

If we are to be successful in creating alternative currencies we must fully examine and understand the two step process (and the role of EOC) in the mainstream system. Because, of course, there are two parties in the creation of a loan. The borrower who must be judged 'trustworthy and able to produce' and the bank, whose ‘job’ (at least in the functional perspective) is merely the evaluating of this.

It is easy to see that, if banks simply created money 'out of thin air' (and into their own account) they would quickly become insolvent. Or at least the shareholders would rapidly deplete their reserve currency if they tried to spend it elsewhere. More importantly, if a bank fails to do a good job of evaluating the creditworthiness of borrowers it will become insolvent as well - even in a healthy economy. [5][6]

We need to understand that even with a simple bank (issuing gold backed, paper money) the 'credit' of the borrowers is in fact packaged up to become the real backing for the paper credit of the bank. In the longer term a bank is able to continue to operate, not because of their gold reserves, but because of the quality of their evaluations of credit. (And the sweat and labour of the debtors to the bank, making good on their credit).

In fact it is by this operation – the evaluating of creditworthiness and spreading/packaging of risk - that money is created out of debt. 

None of this is intended to downplay the vital issues around interest and debt as imperatives to growth and our money system in general as a dangerously unstable and inequitable method by which the elites covertly tax the rest of society. However, these issues were properly examined in the course. I wish here to examine an issue that wasn’t properly examined.

In the expansion of bank credit, a non-liquid (because complex to evaluate) individual creditworthiness is wrapped inside a very liquid (because it’s easy to understand) creditworthiness of a bank. Even though there can be a 'run on a bank' it doesn't change the fact that it is easier to for a barkeep to evaluate the credit worthiness of a paper bank note (as described above) than to evaluate the creditworthiness of, say, a farmer every time he wishes to sate his thirst. From an information processing perspective we can see that the paper note summarizes and simplifies the complex web of information that is an economic society and from a functionalist perspective we might say that this is the true ‘function’ of banks.

It is also, of course crucial to understand the biases that result from the operation of this system. Not least of which is the fact that, because banks are run largely by privileged, white, males money is ‘created’ closer to projects that they find easier to understand. Because of their biases, outright racism, and western centric viewpoints the question of who is carrying out the EOC is inevitably going to have a huge effect on what society we live in. 

Like monarchs of old, when banks (or rather the finance sector in general) decide to 'green light' a given project and not another they have the power to ‘make it so’ even if they don’t actually have the resources, knowledge or labour to hand at the time they make that decision.

<strong>The role of EOC in the world of finance.</strong>

Once we fully understand the pattern by which money (or credit) is created through the packaging and evaluation of risk within a bank (balance sheet expansion) we can then recognize that this same pattern occurs (in a more complicated way) in the world of fixed income capital. It is as if the balance sheet of a bank was exploded across multiple institutions. However the basic expansion of balance sheet pattern is left unchanged, thus leading to ever increasing levels of debt/credit. 

What does change is the question of who is evaluating credit, and how it is done. 

Just as a for instance, if Fiat decides it wants to build, say, a new electric car plant, the credit to actually fund this operation can be a loan to purchase a bond which becomes an asset in a bank, which when deposited provides the ‘currency’ that is used to pay back the loan that provided the currency to purchase the bond in the first place - the funding of which provides the actual money to pay the architects, builders, designers, workers, miners and tea trolley lady who will build the new electric car factory.
If that didn’t make sense, it doesn’t matter. The point is that the funds to build a new factory do not usually come out of profits on existing revenue. Instead the funds are essentially invented as new deposits at the time that the multinational decides to borrow the funds, with the fixed income markets, and specifically financial analysts acting in the role of bank manager to ‘evaluate the creditworthiness’ of the borrower (Fiat).

In fact, fixed income financial analysts pretty much spend all their time 'evaluating the creditworthiness' of large multinationals. The very important bias, however, is that because this is only done with large companies and large sums of money risk is not evaluated for small projects. 
If a hundred thousand people decide they wanted to retrofit their own solar powered cars, the funds to do that would have come out of their actual savings or profits (or via a loan from a traditional bank, with much more restricted ideas as to what is a viable idea.)

<strong>Vertical versus Horizontal money.</strong>

In this way, credit and money today is largely 'vertical' (as opposed to 'horizontal'). It flows in a circle down from the heights of finance capital, to big corporations, into salaries and wages, and then back up through retail and big-box chain stores into interest and payments on the bonds and other instruments that invented the money in the first place. 

Because of this, corporations like Starbucks or Barnes and Noble have a massive advantage over a multitude of small cafes or local bookstores, the credit for which would have to be evaluated independently. Because the evaluation of credit is done in only a few places, and in 'bulk' smaller entities have much higher costs of capital. And because of this bias to the large, it is far too often the case that capital is poorly deployed (even from a purely capitalist perspective) so that the large entities buy much more efficient, independents and promptly go bust. But by then it is too late, because the independent business are already out of business.

If we see a trend towards bigger and more centralized businesses, today, it is worth understanding that this is not just a question of 'economies of scale' but a side effect of the way money is created today.
The role of EOC in alternative currencies

Due to an insufficient analysis of (or perhaps conscious aversion to) the role of evaluation of credit, many credit based alternative currencies do not make an explicit arrangement for the evaluation of credit. 
Certainly, any mutual credit system must carefully walk the line between opening the doors of new membership and new credit too wide and the need to manage a careful on-boarding and exit process [7]. In my experience [8] this work ends up being centralized largely on the unpaid organising committee, and is thus (by definition) hard to scale. 

It is at least possible to make the case that, if there were a more explicit place for evaluation of credit within the workings of the mutual credit system itself, that it would be easier for a mutual credit system to achieve scale. Perhaps this is a *part* of the puzzle as to why alternative credit systems have yet to achieve scale? 

Ripple [6], as noted in the course, is interesting because it is a crypto currencies with a focus on credit, and has the signs of achieving scale. It also makes explicit, in its core operation, the lines of 'trust' (or rather, lines of credit) between individuals. Unfortunately Ripple seems determined to establish its credibility by relationships with big mainstream banks, thus short changing the social goals and much chance of supporting a more horizontal currency. Stellar [8], a fork of Ripple, is at least a bit less 'vertically' focused.

Perhaps there can be an alternative currency that takes the explicit credit lines of something like Ripple and with an 'acknowledgment of the gift' ethic, or a green dollars / timebank mutual credit community.

In fact, this gets us to the interesting point where we find ourselves asking why a project like Villages.CC [8] did not achieve more traction. But that is a topic for an entirely separate essay...

<em>Or rather, that is how today's mind might approach that question. It is a bit of a side issue, but fascinating to consider that in the historical context, it was not uncommon for people to think the value of paper money was some sort of alchemy, seemingly derived from the high technology of intricate plates and printing presses that somehow combined to create a new type of money. This has obvious parallels to perceptions around bitcoin today. </em>
